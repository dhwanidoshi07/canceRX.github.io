                All use of your personal data is confined to the purposes stated above, and is only undertaken to the extent necessary for these purposes. Personal data will not be transferred to government bodies or public authorities except in order to comply with mandatory national legislation, or if the transfer of such data should be necessary in order to take legal action in cases of fraudulent access to our network infrastructure.

                <h4>3. SHARING OF INFORMATION</h4>
                <hr>
                We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of CanceRX unless one of the following circumstances applies:
                With your consent
                We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of CanceRX when you have given us your prior consent for this use.

                For legal reasons
                We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of CanceRX if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
                meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request
                enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations
                detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues
                protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of CanceRX, our users or the public as required or permitted by law
                We may share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you, publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
                If CanceRX is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
                <h4>4. SECURITY</h4>
                <hr>
                We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities. CanceRX implements technical and organizational security measures to safeguard stored personal data against inadvertent or deliberate manipulation, loss or destruction and against access by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological progress.
                <h4>5. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h4>
                <hr>
                Our webpages may contain links to other providers’ webpages. We would like to point out that this statement of data protection conditions applies exclusively to the webpages managed by CanceRX, and not to websites owned by third parties. We may provide links to other websites which we believe may be of interest to our visitors. We aim to ensure that such websites are of the highest standard. However, due to the nature of the internet, we cannot guarantee the privacy standards of websites to which we link or be responsible for the contents of sites other than this one, and this Privacy Policy is not intended to be applicable to any linked, non-CanceRX site.
                <h4>6. RIGHT TO INFORMATION, CORRECTION AND OBJECTION</h4>
                <hr>
                You have the right to inspect any stored data concerning your person, and also the right to demand their correction or deletion, and to withdraw your consent for their further use. If you wish to contact us regarding our use of your Personal Data or object to the processing of your Personal Data, please email us at support@cancerx.co.in If you contact us, please note the name of the website where you provided the information, as well as the specific information you would like us to correct, update or delete plus a proper identification of you. Requests to delete personal data will be subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document filing or retention obligations imposed on us.
                <h4>7. CHANGES</h4>
                <hr>
                By using our website, you implicitly agree to accept the use of your personal data as specified above. This present statement of data protection conditions came into effect on 23rd July 2021. As our website evolves, and new technologies come into use, it may become necessary to amend the statement of data protection conditions.
                CanceRX reserves the right to modify its data protection conditions at any time, with effect as of a future date. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We recommend that you re-read the latest version from time to time.
